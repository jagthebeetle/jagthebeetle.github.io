I use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. (This is actually through a similar mechanism Google uses to serve interest-based ads to you, in case you'd ever seen an ad that was curiously on point.)

I use the information I get from Google Analytics only to improve this site and sate my curiosity about aggregate statistics. 
Google Analytics receives a hit with some technical details about your browser, the page you're on, and mostly for geolocating purposes, your IP address (but any web request will have your IP attached to it anyway), plus I never get to see the IP. Your name and other identifying information are not collected. I do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.

<p>
Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user, the cookie is more or less a random string of numbers, plus the timestamp of your first visit. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser or using the GA Opt-Out Extension.

P.S. This policy is purloined and modified from another website. The other website's version was somewhat inaccurate, I thought.
