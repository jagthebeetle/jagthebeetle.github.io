	<h1>200 OK</h1>

	It seems to me, having, for better or worse, cartwheeled through Academe, that skepticism is the natural end toward which any thoughtful, if carousing, journey through those idyllic groves ought to tend.
	</p>
	<img src="img/alice.jpg">
	<p>
	(Of course, such is and has always been my easy way to shirk assignments and exhortations to wrestle with material that&mdash;somehow&mdash;somebody sometime thought was useful.
	</p>
	<p>
	Perhaps, that is, skepticism is acedia's panacea&mdash;inertia's nostrum! (&mdash;and at the end of a brief trip through my lovely Lyceum, maybe I just fear I feel I haven't drunk a long enough drink from the inkhorn or sampled the donnish distillates that might have rent the <em>veil</em>. (Which veil? Well, how could I know, having never even noticed I was so atrociously enshrouded?))
	</p>
	<p>
	(To all of which, darling delightful skepticism says, &ldquo;<em>Pshaw</em>. Egghead.&rdquo; So humbly, in its coy tyranny, it turns on itself.))
	</p>
	<p>
	If not an altogether contemnible outlook, however, skepticism may just be one of the healthier positions to adopt. Washing oneself of most everything, one is still left with something. Or as Jinny Woolf put it, when the universe is debrided of its wacky shapes and edifices, &ldquo;it is not oneself but something in the universe that one's left with,&rdquo; &ldquo;somehow beautiful, as it flits with its lantern restlessly up and down the dark corridors.&rdquo; 
	</p>
	<img src="img/tsarevna.jpg">
	<p>
	That is, skepticism is a way of boiling away that sea of troubles that Hamlet cried long and hard about. (Maybe it's a boiling that, hardy har har, is only possible if that sea is small enough&mdash;which, as someone whose current greatest trouble is his self-imposed decision to dispense with jQuery, I can probably say is true for my teacup sea.) Left on the benthic desert, one can more closely look at these hands, this self, and the things that have, for all the simmering away, clung. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I am left, for instance, with the vastness of the universe, my relative insignificance, the incomprehensibility of pride amid the tentacular, bestial vestiges of our australopithecine forebears, &ldquo;the themes thou lovest best, night, sleep, death and the stars&rdquo; (quoth Whitman). Bleak, perhaps, but never sad.
	</p>
	<p>
	But that's the crux of my&mdash;delusion, I'll call it: to banish meaning and retain, despite meaninglessness' devastating invasiveness, any existential stability; to unmoor oneself and ride whatever current existence careens through, if not in the peace which passeth understanding, in a peace that, at any rate, general nihilism does not immediately seem to offer up&mdash;to figure out some dramamine against that seasickness that scares your average learn&egrave;d landlubber away.
	</p>
	<p>
	Smiling tears, 物の哀れ, are among the purer essences that remain after much (youthful) thought. The appreciative goodbye is the motive force impelling education and mental refinement, the move from more childish conceptions towards an abstraction that seems like it ought, gradually, to explain away all things, each time a veil (or bourne) that, crossed, no traveler returns from.</p> 
	<p>
	In the blithe goodbye to the world as unshakeable is an abstraction that if providing no meaning (doing the opposite, in fact), allows one to embrace the darling thing that tries so hard in spite of it all. One is left looking an outlandish lunatic, probably:
	</p>

	<blockquote><em>
	if I in my north room <br>
	dance naked, grotesquely <br>
	before my mirror <br>
	waving my shirt round my head <br>
	and singing softly to myself: <br>
	&ldquo;I am lonely, lonely. <br>
	I was born to be lonely, <br>
	I am best so!&rdquo; <br>
	&hellip;<br>
	Who shall say I am not <br>
	the happy genius of my household?</em>
	</blockquote>
	<img src="img/flammarion.jpg">
	<p>
	Such a sales pitch, this&mdash;mood lighting and insubstantial&mdash;but a place from which to begin the never mindlessly but certainly senselessly babbled response code, &ldquo;<code>200 OK</code>.&rdquo; Alles gut.

	In fact, it&rsquo;s comforting to remember the following chain: Eukaryota, Animalia, Chordata, Therapsida, Mammalia, Primates, Hominidae, Hominini, Homo, Homo Sapiens Sapiens. It is part of that tree in which I am a node: indefinitely as it stretches before me, estimates place its root, my greatest grandparent, 1.6–2.1 billion years ago.</p>
	<img src="img/babar.png">

<p>That parent too was something&rsquo;s child.</p>

<p>A snap, an accidental sexless, reproductive collision, a divine spark—a ripple in the fabric comprising the universe I keep looking to. A fabric that has been exploding and unfurling for 14 billion years, occasionally collapsing on itself and making the beautiful anthropomorphic shapes that I am one of: atomic configurations that can create, think, feel that they are&mdash;no different, yet, from any of the other beautiful wrinkles that must too, someday, pull taut and be undone. The fabric flows, after all, by the laws of entropy: I was once scattered inside the dimensionless ovum that gave birth to it all, and I will one day be scattered again. If I am in a river flowing downhill, to a quietly humming standstill, in a cave where nothing begets nothing, I am&mdash;we are&mdash;the mysterious eddies and whirls that defy that entropic gravity, splashing, arcing up, seemingly undying arabesques that must yet collapse, even as they kaleidoscope for instants as brief as the tracks of a particle collision, &ldquo;alive forever in the split second / Auto headlights more sudden than [&hellip;]&rdquo; Atlases, we carry and stand upon the weight of everything before and after us.</p>
<img src="img/frog.jpg">

<p>There is a mathematical allure in these infinities of infinitesimal length (continuity&rsquo;s carnival): this felt paradox teems with existential meaning; the sensation that my happiness matters to me, in its fragile infinity.</p>

<p>Sorrow I can chase away, that is, by remembering that it is short-lived&mdash;by thinking on my infinitesimal life, remembering how large the universal tree is, remembering that I was a child once, that I might well, though probably not, be the root of a tree, of children or ideas or things, as large as that whose descendant I am.</p>

<p>I am as large as I am small.</p>
