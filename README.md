## Things & Thinks

[jagthebeetle.github.io](https://jagthebeetle.github.io) has gone through a few incarnations, but it remains a playground and diary of sorts. Apart from fascinating content, it is a place for ongoing experimentation with a few features.

These are the current primary concerns:

- Streamlining the Jekyll build process so Angular can play nicely with pre-rendered content, and the site can play nicely with crawlers
- Google Analytics data collection, augmented with tidbits like User-Agent and tracking configuration version
- Depth in flatness; not quite flat and not quite material design
- JavaScript musing
- D3
- Meta tags, structured data

The site is built with:

- [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
- [D3](https://d3js.org/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
